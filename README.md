--- Discontinued ---


OilSpill_original: original code made before I came to discoverE. It uses the turtle library to make a
space invaders remake with a player character, oil sprite, and a cleaner sprite.

OilSpill_1.0: My attempt at a remake using the turtle library. The movements and interractions are more
responsive and accurate. The code from the kids perspective is easier to follow. However, the turtle
library is very slow and dramatically decreases the fps with each new sprite. I tried looking for a way
around this issue but it seemed the better solution was to unfortunetly discontinue this attempt and fall
back to the original code.

OilSpill_1.1: This a new attempt to remake the entire thing using pygame instead. This is more challenging
to make it simple and understandable from the kids perspective, but the quality of code and game mechanics
will prove to be significantly better. However this may not get finished in time and will remain a remnant
of what could have been. Maybe next years tech specialist may find this and attempt to continue.
